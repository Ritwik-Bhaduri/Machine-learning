# Machine-learning
Here are some of the algorithms for machine learning mostly clustering.....

The main topics included are: 
1. **K means clustering**
2. **Image clustering using K means:**
> Kmeans used to cluster images
3. **K means using _Gradient Descent_:**
> As in the paper "Convergence properties of kmeans" by Leon Bottou and Yoshua Bengio k means can be expressed as a gradient                 descent algorithm with superlinear convergence rate (It's equivalent to Newton's method). This is the implementation of                     kmeans as gradient descent.
4. **Graphs of _Cost-Function_ versus centroids:**
> It includes the graph of cost function of k means for one dimensional data (euclidean distance) and shows that for one dimension the cost function in concave upward and hence with unique local minimum. 
5. **_Min-Max_ Kmeans algorithm:** 
> This algorithm aims to solve the initialisation problems in k-means by minimising the size(variance) of the largest cluster.It effectively tries to form clusters of more or less same sizes.
