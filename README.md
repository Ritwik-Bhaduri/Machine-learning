# Machine-learning
Here are some of the algorithms for machine learning mostly clustering.....
The main topics included are: 
  1. K means clustering
  2. Image clustering using K means:
		Kmeans used to cluster images
  3. K means using gradient descent:
		As in the paper "Convergence properties of kmeans" by Leon Bottou and Yoshua Bengio k means can be expressed as a gradient                 descent algorithm with superlinear convergence rate (It's equivalent to Newton's method). This is the implementation of                     kmeans as gradient descent.
  4. Graphs of cost function versus centroids:
     	        It includes the graph of cost function of k means for one dimensional data (euclidean distance) and shows that for one    		  dimension the cost function in concave upward and hence with unique local minimum. 
  5. Min-Max Kmeans algorithm: 
                This algorithm aims to solve the initialisation problems in k-means by minimising the size(variance) of the largest 			cluster.It effectively tries to form clusters of more or less same sizes.
