# Machine-learning
Here are some of the algorithms for machine learning mostly clustering.....
The main topics included are: 
  1. K means clustering
  2. Image clustering using K means
  3. K means using gradient decend
  4. Graphs pf cost function versus centroids
  5. Min-Max Kmeans algorithm: 
              This algorithm aims to solve the initialisation problems in k-means bu minimising the size(variance) of the largest cluster.               It effectively tries to form clusters of more or less same sizes.
